# Camouflaged-Object-Detection-with-IFBO_Net-Model
Integrated Fusion and Boundary Optimization is mainly composed of  three modules : Focus Intersection Decoder (FID) is responsible for roughly locating the initial position of the object; the Feature Hybrid Interaction Module (FHIM) enables full interaction between features and capture the object local details and the (BRM)  to optimize boundaries.
# Camouflaged Object Detection using SegNet, U-Net, and IFBONet

This project implements Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) using three deep learning architectures: **SegNet**, **U-Net**, and **IFBONet**. The goal is to segment objects that are visually camouflaged in complex scenes using supervised semantic segmentation.

## 📁 Dataset: COD10K

Dataset used: [COD10K on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/getcam/cod10k)

### Structure:

- 10,000 camouflaged object images with annotations.
- Divided into **Train**, **Validation**, and **Test** sets.
- Each sample includes:
  - RGB image
  - GT\_Object (segmentation mask)
  - GT\_Edge (object edges)
  - GT\_Instance (instance masks)

## 🧠 Architectures Used

### 🔹 U-Net

- Encoder-decoder network with skip connections.
- Captures context and enables precise localization.

### 🔹 SegNet

- Encoder-decoder based on VGG16.
- Upsampling uses pooling indices from encoder.

### 🔹 IFBONet

- A custom architecture for COD based on **Integrate Fusion and Boundary Optimization**.
- Performed with:
  - **SGD optimizer**
  - **Learning Rate Scheduler**
  - **Gradient Clipping**
  - **CrossEntropy + Dice Loss**

## 📊 PyTorch Training Pipeline

```python
def train(model, loader, optimizer, criterion, device):
    model.train()
    epoch_loss = 0
    for imgs, masks in loader:
        imgs, masks = imgs.to(device), masks.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(imgs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, masks)
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
        optimizer.step()
        epoch_loss += loss.item()
    return epoch_loss / len(loader)
```

## 📊 PyTorch Evaluation Pipeline

```python
def evaluate(model, loader, criterion, device):
    model.eval()
    eval_loss = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for imgs, masks in loader:
            imgs, masks = imgs.to(device), masks.to(device)
            outputs = model(imgs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, masks)
            eval_loss += loss.item()
    return eval_loss / len(loader)
```
for reducing mae 
def compute_mae(pred, gt):
    return torch.abs(pred - gt).mean().item()
    use this function for better results.
